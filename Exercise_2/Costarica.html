        <h4 style=font-size:medium;color:blueviolet> La Fortuna Waterfall</h4>
        La Fortuna Waterfall sits just outside town and is popular with travelers and
        locals looking to cool off in the impressive natural pools. </li>
        <br>
        <img src="/Images/costa-rica-in-pictures-beautiful-places-to-photograph-rio-celeste-waterfall.jpg" width="200" height="200">

<h5 style=font-size:medium;color:blueviolet> Volcano National Park</h5>
<br>
<img src="/Images/arenal-volcano.jpg" width="200" height="200">
        <li>The national park where the Arenal Volcano sits is one of the absolute must things to do in La Fortuna, Costa Rica. </li>
<li>It’s also the country’s most active volcano, with lava flowing continuously since its eruption in 1968. </li>
    <li>Don’t worry though, park rangers keep a close eye on volcanic activity and close the parts of the trail that they feel are unsafe.</li>
    <li>Arenal Volcano National Park is about 30 minutes from La Fortuna and is the perfect place to hike and get a better understanding of Costa Rica’s famous nature.</li>
         (Entrance fee: 17 USD)

         <img src="/Images/hanging-bridge.jpg" width ="300" height="300">      
    <li> The Mistico Arenal Hanging Bridges are a bucket list thing to do in La Fortuna. Discover the unique hanging bridges suspended among the rainforest canopy as you walk among amazing animals like sloths, tarantulas, and frogs.</li>

        <li>As you walk, take the time to look down onto the stunning forest from the incredible height of 45 meters (or 148 feet)! Floating among the treetops, listening to the peaceful sounds of wildlife around you is truly an experience like no other. (For more wildlife visit Manuel Antonio National Park)</li>
