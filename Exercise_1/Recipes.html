    <h1> Paneer Tikka Masala</h1>
    <h2> Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Paneer Tikka Masala is a popular Indian curry where cubes of 
        paneer (Indian cottage cheese), onions and peppers are marinated 
        with yogurt and spices,     
        grilled and then tossed in a creamy tomato 
        based curry. This dish goes extremely well with butter naan or 
        paratha or basmati rice.
